# Similarly, using `@composer` in your composer.json will implicitly use this file.

# If you want to ensure that the project is always built with same version of composer as you use locally, add the corresponding composer.phar (from e.g. https://getcomposer.org/composer-2.phar) and put it into bin/ directory.
# This ensures that the DEV box and CI/CD will use the same version of composer and you get a more reproducible and similar build from DEV to production
# If bin/composer.phar does not exist, the script will fallback to a system composer version, whatever version this might be.
